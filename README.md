# Face Recognition System

A Python-based face detection and recognition system using **OpenCV** and the **face_recognition** library.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Locate human faces in images or video streams  
- **Face Recognition**: Identify and verify individuals from a stored dataset  
- **Real-time Processing**: Recognize faces from webcam input in real-time  
- **Dataset Support**: Add and manage multiple faces for recognition  
- **Multiple Face Handling**: Detect and recognize more than one face in the same frame  

## Installation
